## How to Run the Project Locally

Follow these steps to clone, set up, and run the application on your local machine:

---

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** and **npm**: Download and install from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Steps to Run the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone <REPOSITORY_LINK>
     ```
     Replace `<REPOSITORY_LINK>` with the GitHub repository URL I shared with you.

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**
   - Move into the folder where the project files are located:
     ```bash
     cd <PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME>
     ```
     Replace `<PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME>` with the name of the folder created after cloning.

3. **Install Dependencies**
   - Install the required packages using npm:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

4. **Run the Application**
   - Start the development server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - This will open the application in your default web browser. If it doesn't, go to:
     ```
     http://localhost:3000
     ```
